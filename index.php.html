      <div id="descriptiontext">
        This documentary tells the story of an Italian physician named Girolamo Donzellini (1513-1587). Donzellini worked in the Venetian Republic in the sixteenth century and was sentenced to death as a heretic by the Inquisition in 1587. Donzellini crossed paths with other Italian religious dissenters on the stage of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Major themes addressed include the Protestant Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, the Republic of Letters, the relationship between heresy and medicine, the problem of religious intolerance, and the attendant rise of movements for freedom of thought and religion in the early modern period. The narration of Donzellini’s life and his heretical network encourages reflection upon the value of personal and intellectual freedom, critical thinking, and anti-dogmatism and promotes rumination on the dangers of repression, conformism, and homogeneity.
        <br /><br />
        Using information uncovered by a detailed examination of original historical sources, each section of the documentary describes a different phase of the adventurous life of Girolamo Donzellini, an archetypal Italian heretic. Artistic representations of Donzellini’s life are contextualized by a team of selected historians who elaborate on the context of his actions and lead the audience on a historical trip through sixteenth-century Italy in a time of great suspicion and tension. The film-makers chose this approach to emphasize the connections between major historical transformations and the daily life of individuals in the past.
        <br /><br />
        Following the path of Donzellini and his life, the documentary was shot on location in Venice, Verona, Padua and Ferrara. The film also includes interviews with expert historians shot in Turin and Seattle, WA, original art and graphics by young artists <a class="textlink" href="https://www.davidefasolo.com/" alt="Davide Fasolo's website" title="Davide Fasolo's website" hreflang="en" target="_blank">Davide Fasolo</a> and <a class="textlink" href="https://www.instagram.com/pitto_illustrator/?utm_medium=copy_link" alt="Pietro Cozzi's Instagram page" title="Pietro Cozzi's Instagram page" hreflang="en" target="_blank">Pietro Cozzi</a>, images of primary source documents, and an original soundtrack composed by Andrea Nejrotti. Chiara Lombardo gave a vital contribution as the project’s artistic consultant. The documentary is a thoroughly international project and is shot in a mix of English and Italian. We believe that this level of globalism is important, and appropriate for a story that is itself international in nature.
        <br /><br />
        There are four versions of the film. Two 45 minute edits (one with English subtitles and one with Italian subtitles) and two longer edits that are intended for an academic audience or anyone who wants to dive a little deeper into Donzellini’s story (again one with English subtitles, the other with Italian). Our goal with this project was to create a compelling, educational and thought provoking documentary that could be enjoyed by a broad cross-section of people as we believe the themes of the documentary are universally applicable and of timeless importance. We wanted to create a film that was publicly accessible but that also reflected the abundance of original historical research that went into unearthing Donzellini’s story.
        <br /><br />
        The documentary is based on six years of solid research and investigation of original sources from the Venetian Inquisition archives and copious historiographical volumes, effectively summarized in a short film. The fusion of chronological dynamic story-telling by subject experts and a narrator, mixed with original music, animations, sketches and footage shot on location makes this project special. Moreover, the  mix of different experiences, skills, intellectual perspectives, and cultural approaches to the past and our contemporary world of those involved in the project has resulted in a successful and illuminating work.

        The production of this non-profit documentary has been partly sponsored by the European Union, under the Horizon 2020, Marie Curie Global Fellowship (<a class="textlink" href="https://celati-netdis.github.io/project/" alt="Medicine, Heresy, and Freedom of Thought in Sixteenth-Century Italy" title="Medicine, Heresy, and Freedom of Thought in Sixteenth-Century Italy" hreflang="en" target="_blank">NETDIS 748645</a>) that Alessandra Celati held between 2017 and 2019. Other funding came from crowdfunding that we launched in 2019 using the online platforms Patreon and Kickstarter.
