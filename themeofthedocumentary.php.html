      <span class="italicquote">“We might hold the right to freedom of thought dearly. But do we really value true and independent thinking?”</span>
      <br /><br />
      In the sixteenth-century religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, there was no space for theological minorities. Those who deviated from the mainstream position of their homeland, no matter how slightly, were considered outsiders and enemies to the integrity of their society. Those, like Donzellini, who defended religious peace and valued freedom of thought in spiritual matters paradoxically faced a greater risk of ostracization and oppression, doomed to be persecuted by all institutionalized denominations of European Christendom. These people would have been erased from the pages of history if the traces of their militancy had not been preserved in their correspondence, in the books they wrote, and rather ironically, in the historical archives of their persecutors, the Inquisitors.
      <br /><br />
      These historical records often tell stories of violence, exile, betrayal, torture, and death, but they can also tell us about other things like courage, hope, tenacity, kinship, and solidarity. These stories illuminate the development of a secret social network of dissenters, whose cultural values of intellectual curiosity, early cosmopolitanism, and anti-authoritarianism are still at the core of the modern Western identity.
      <br /><br />
      Who were these dissenters? What kinds of lives did they live? What motivated them to risk, and sometimes to lose, their own lives in the name of something so opposed by the authorities of their societies? In an attempt to answer these questions and more, this documentary aims to reconstruct the biography of the heretical physician Girolamo Donzellini and the physical and social environments in which he lived. Girolamo was born in 1513 in Orzi Nuovi, a little town in the Venetian Republic, during the most traumatic plague the town had ever experienced. Against the odds, he survived. Considering how precarious Donzellini’s adult life would be and how many times he would escape death, it is tempting to imagine that by breathing death and sorrow in the first months of his life, Girolamo Donzellini acquired a sort of resilience that allowed him to survive all sorts of peril—all but one. He survived the plagues of 1513 and 1575, torture, and religious exile, but he would meet his end at the hands of the Venetian inquisition, drowned in the Venetian lagoon one spring night in 1587. He was 74 years old.
      <img class="textimage1" src="img/piazza_san_marco_gentile_bellini.jpg" alt="Piazza San Marco by Gentile Bellini" title="Piazza San Marco by Gentile Bellini">
      To recreate the events that led to such a tragic resolution, the documentary follows Donzellini and his travels to Padua, Rome, Venice, and Basel, navigating pharmacy shops, centers of power such as embassies and the Emperor’s itinerant court, and the Inquisition’s prisons.
      <br /><br />
      Although Donzellini’s father instilled heretical beliefs in him from a young age, it was in Padua, where Girolamo Donzellini graduated in medicine, that his heterodox ideas intensified and radicalized. What had started as an opposition to Roman Catholicism became a commitment to the defense of religious peace and the complete rejection of any form of institutionalized Christianity. Donzellini went through four Inquisition trials. He survived torture, jail time, and plagues, but in this period of dogmatism and uniformity of thought, his intellectual liveliness ultimately led to his execution. He was caught and charged for the last time for the possession and distribution of prohibited books in 1587. As a highly intelligent individual and a cosmopolitan humanist, Donzellini had been able to escape the Inquisition many times by disguising his aversion for the Roman Church. He could abandon his wife, his son, and his patients in order to flee from Italy when he needed to, but he could never renounce his intellectual curiosity. That was his undoing.
      <br /><br />
      Although Donzellini’s story is unique (full of events and well documented as it is), it is representative of the wider sixteenth-century heretical world. For this reason in the documentary Donzellini’s face is never visible. Donzellini was a common man and was not portrayed by artists, as it happened to men of power. Moreover we have decided to have him somewhat faceless in recognition of the representativeness of his story. His case, alongside the interviews with historical experts, are used in the documentary to illustrate the experiences of early modern religious dissenters, who, hopeless and doomed as they were, embodied a small, but vitally important step towards the rise of the freedom of thought.
      <br /><br />
      The story of Donzellini and his network is an authentic testimony of the most genuine refusal to conform and a sincere defense of peace and intellectual creativity, which had nothing to do with the abstract conception of “freedom” all too often mistaken, abused, and banalized today. If history is written by the winners, this documentary hopes to bring to light the legacy of a “secret sociality” and the radical life choices of men and women that while branded as “scandalous”, represent the true banner of freedom. Their stories encourage us to re-think our own understanding of what that term truly means.
